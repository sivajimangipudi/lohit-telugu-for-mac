LOHIT TELUGU FOR MAC

Unicode Lohit Telugu font for the Macintosh. Ported from Linux to the Mac.

Lohit Telugu is a Unicode font that works on Linux and the PC.
The only thing keeping it broken on the Macintosh is the lack of a Morph Input File.
I have written this file, and repackaged the font with -**ftxenhancer**- a tool provided by Apple.

See the featured section on the left hand side to download the font. Download the file named Lohit-Telugu.ttf and double click on it. Font Book app will prompt you to install the font.

You can also download the Morph input file if you need it. It has the extension .mif
Although the extension is a .mif, it's just a text file . So you can open it with a text editor.
